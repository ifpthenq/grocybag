Ubuntu WSL
#Install apache2 and php
- in WSL php won't work unless you start the service
> sudo service php8.2-fpm start (or restart)
- use apt install to add any modules needed by the base grocy program. (fileinfo, pdo_sqlite, gd, ctype, intl, zlib, mbstring)
- the php service needs to be restarted every time you install a module to find the next module you need
- you need to run ifconfig to get the ipaddress of your WSL. I had to install some network tools to get ifconfig to run. The ip address
is where you will find the front page of grocy. Mine is currently 172.25.80.236

#Use wget http://addressOfDownload. 
- Unzip the download into /app/grocy
# A note about file permissions
- Not sure if this is strictly necessary, but set all files ownership www-data:www-data (Because I believe my apache accesses
them as this user. In order to be able to edit them, you need to add your Windows user to whatever group you have set the files
to be owned by (chmod -aG ...) and also set all of the files to 755 (so that group members can edit them). 

#   The conf file for apahce2 is /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf (or sites-available?)
#          In this file you change the DocumentRoot to be /app/grocy/public
- You need to add this to the /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
<Directory /app/grocy/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
</Directory>

#To setup editing with VSCode
- In VSCode make sure you have the WSL extension added, and do ctrl+shift+P and type in "WSL:New Window"
- this will open a new VSCode window attached to the WSL drive. Click on the open location button and put in /app/grocy
